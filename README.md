# Advanced_Hotel_Management_API
This code is a one step forward of the [Hotel_Management_API](https://github.com/Estate360/Hotel_Management_API) repository I uploaded last. 

## Changes to Expect:
Here;
1. I applied my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to refactor the code.
2. I went further to build a system of USERS, assigning the role of GUEST and ADMIN to them.
3. I further more ensured that I the Authentication and Authorization middleware is second to none by efficiently applying bcrypt, jwt and joi.

###MORE UPDATE COMING SOON!
